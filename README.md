# Robot-arm_ControlPanel

A project for SmartMethods Internship the software development process of a robotic arm.

-I designed a Web page to control a Robot arm , API (Application Programming Interface) using html, css, javascript to controls the movement of robot arm, each part of arm have range bar 0-180 degree .
	
-After that I designed a database with two tables(Engines,Run) and  I connected it with the Interface to insert values of each engine and where it on  into corresponding column of the table.

These two task are in ROBOT CONTROLLERS.php file 

-Then I designed a Web page -Run.php- to display the last record inserted in Run table which contained the value of ON/OFF column 1 to indicate ON .
